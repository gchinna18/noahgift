âš¡ Fun facts: I was as a bouncer in college with former UFC Champion Chuck Liddell.  Early in my career I worked on the [movie Avatar while living in New Zealand](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2104112/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1).  I used to play basketball with Adam Sandler at lunch when I worked at Sony Imageworks in Los Angeles, CA.
